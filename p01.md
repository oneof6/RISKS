## Development

Ah, the art of software development. As you might know from my profile on renowned websites, I started very early in the IT business as a developer. As such I was and I am always interested in what's going on in this area. I also still do programming and if I feel to have a need to refresh my skills, I ramp up a hobby project and create a video game in one of the languages I think I might need to dig deeper now. This section will have some articles about software development in general, everything I think might be of interest and worth sharing. 


**Requirements: The game of estimating efforts (WP DONE)**

"Jack, we have a new requirement and we need to know the cost for the customer!". Well, I guess we all who are working in the IT sector know this classic event. Now there are a variety of methods and experiences around how to do an estimate and no...guessing is not one of them. Classical methods include (just to name a few):
-> Check similar requirements from former projects (learn from experience)
-> Estimation poker (check a first estimate with two or three fellow IT guys and use the average)
-> T-Shirt sizes (have some defined packages of effort with a scope description and apply it to the effort at hand)
Now there are times when the first of the above is the quickest and most adequate, for instance if we estimate a complete project rather than a single requirement. In the agile world it is even different, as here we want to offer time boxes with a defined set of effort to be burned in a time box and this effort can be used to fulfil requirements that can be done in that time. Hence, we let the customer or product owner prioritise what shall go in a so called "sprint". Nevertheless, even here we need to come up with estimates. Also there will be times when we have a high uncertainty in the requirements, be it because they deviate from former experience, are completely new and have never been done and...so on. What often worked quite well is a combination of the methods mentioned. So going in your favourite system of record to check the estimation of a similar topic for a former project and check back with some of your peers whether it makes  sense. The T-Shirt sizing is something only really applicable to topics that scale well. Let's say I know that it takes 1 day to organise a simple party but 5 days to prepare something big (yes, with live music on stage) I can sell the packages small and big. If someone orders 10 big events, I apply my T-Shirts and can tell it takes 50 days. Now depending on the people who can be engaged for conducting the work, the effort can be parallelised and even though we still have an effort of 50 days, with 10 people working on each event we can have the parties all ready by the end of the week. So the effort and the duration are two different things...but this is just a side note. Bottom line, try to use former experience with a quick check of the effort with some colleagues. If this is not possible, try to get as much information about the requirement and possible solutions as you can and try to find out what the solution would cost by reading blogs, forums and all information channels you have available. Always remember, there is more than coding in creating software, so don't forget to factor in designs, tests, training and rollouts.

- Architecture: Systems thinking

- Design: DTO Data Transfer Object (WP DONE, LinkedIn DONE)
Lately I came across a situation in a project, which demanded some mental work to reduce the continuous database queries throughout a cohesive business logic. I was suggesting a concept we use for this kind of problem known as DTO. Now I thought it would be great to share that and decided to write this small article. So, let's go!

Ever witnessed a situation where you want to use data from a database in a sub procedure or a function called in the middle of a hierarchy of other actions. Well, probably as it is a quite common action to read again some data in a later execution point within a program, even though some data has been provided as input to the program in the first place. But why is the need there if the data has been passed once? Maybe the data used as the input was not complete or we now need data related to the original data. There are good reasons why this happens and there are as good reasons not to do it...ok now we might say wait, why not doing it if it is common? Well asking back a system for data we could have collected beforehand costs, it costs memory, time, performance and so on. Therefore, if we come across a situation in our program that seems like we are querying over and over again for the same data just to get different columns or a related data set, we should think of a structure to preload this data and give it to the program right from the start. This is what a Data Transfer Object is about. The idea is to assemble an object that can hold the information we would like to use throughout the program and feed that into the program at the start. Then when need be, we just access the properties of the DTO needed in our program and we don't e.g. query back a DB. Such an object can be as easy as a JSON string, which holds the data we want to use even if we use this at a later stage. Getting the data we need later from an object, rather than the DB, is way cheaper than asking back again. We have some concepts in our practice to make use of this pattern and teach our people to think about it when they design.

Hence the tip: Before querying back, think about preloading the data to a DTO.
